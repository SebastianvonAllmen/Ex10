## EX. 10
### General Advice
This is the README file of my Ex. 10. To run this project you must have a microcontroller with the same specs
as in the Course BTF 3232. It will also work on other since we are only using the CMSIS library, but you will
have to do some adjustment for the GPIOS

### PuTTY
I can only recommend for you to use PuTTY as your serial communication provider. It will highly increase user
experience since you will be able to Play the notes on your keyboard without having to press Enter. For further 
instructions refer to the Abstract in the docs Folder.
